### Frontend: 

#### Multiple screens that you can navigate between.

- Using the bottom sheet, you can switch between different screens by clicking on the "Tasks", "Events", and "Categories" buttons.

#### At least one scrollable view.

- The bottom sheet is a scrollable view. When expanding it fully, and when there are many events, you can scroll through them.

#### Networking integration with a backend API.

- We used a backend API to create a demonstration "CS Class" under "Events". When you add more events it can be displayed on the "Events" screen
